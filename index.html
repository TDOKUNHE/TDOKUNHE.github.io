      <h3>Reasons to visit <em>Victoria Falls</em></h3>
      <p>Victoria Falls is literally the greatest tourist attraction in Zimbabwe and Zambia
        <br> and one of the 7 Natural Wonders of the World.  In 2019, around one million tourists
        <br> visited Victoria Falls!
        Victoria Falls was named after the reigning Queen of England
        <br> by Scottish explorer,
        <br> missionary, and anti-slavery champion, Dr. David Livingstone. The locals called the
        <br> falls Mosi-oa-Tunya meaning “smoke that thunders”. Many people still refer to this
        <br> nickname, which accurately defines the power of the falls crashing into the canyon
        <br> floor.</p>
        
        <p>&bull; It is the largest waterfall in the world based on width and height.
          <br>
         &bull; It measures one mile wide (1.7 km) and 360 feet high (108 meters).
          <br>
          &bull; The Victoria Falls became a World Heritage Site in 1989 
          <br>
           &bull; This means it belongs to all the people of the word, irrespective
           <br> of the territory on which the World Heritage site is.</p>

        <h3>WHY VISIT <em>CAPETOWN</em> </h3>
        <p>Set on a rugged peninsula between the Indian and Atlantic Oceans with iconic Table Mountain
          <br> as its backdrop, the city of Cape Town sits in one of the world's most spectacular settings.
          <br> But the scenery isn't restricted to the city alone: short drives take visitors to white sandy
          <br> beaches, traditional fishing villages and wild mountain ranges while must-see destinations
          <br> such as Cape Point, the Cape Winelands and the whale-watching capital of Hermanus are easy day
          <br> trips. With so many beautiful places to explore, you only have to visit Africa's favourite city
          <br> once and you’ll probably be planning your next Cape Town travel holiday before your tan’s
          <br> had time to fade. Cape Town will appeal to just about anyone in the mood for a holiday:
          <br> romantics and honeymooners will love the exquisite accommodation and idyllic views; families
          <br> with children can share a beach with inquisitive penguins; adventure lovers will relish the
          <br> chance to discover the secrets of Table Mountain - one of the 7 Natural Wonders of the World!
          <br> - and gourmets shouldn't miss out on South Africa's finest food and wine experiences, served up
          <br> at an affordable price. It's a multi-faceted destination that deserves to be explored.
          <br> Naturally, there are dozens of scheduled tours on offer but many visitors prefer to travel to
          <br> Cape Town and discover this friendly and slow-paced city at their own pace: take some time to
          <br> browse African craft markets in the walkably compact city centre, visit the colourful Cape
          <br> Malay suburb of Bo Kaap, lounge on its best beaches and stroll around the ever-popular V&A
          <br> Waterfront with its shops, restaurants and luxurious hotels.</p>

     <h3>WHY VISIT <em>BALI</em></h3>
     <p>&bull; Balinese culture fosters beautiful artistry amongst its people. There is regular, if not daily, <br> participation in the Hindu-animist culture which include a lot of art and music. A very large <br>proportion of the Balinese play the musical instruments used in their religious culture. A great many <br>of them paint, sculpt, carve, and make jewelry whose designs come straight out of their culture. They <br>have mostly resisted producing the homogenous knick-knacks that characterize the tourist shops in <br>much of the world. For tourists this means a treasure trove of unique and beautiful crafts and the <br>frequent opportunity of seeing them created right in front of you. There is live Balinese music in <br>almost every street, rice paddy, temple and accommodation.</p>
     <p>&bull; The Hindu-Animist culture differs not only from the predominantly Muslim culture of the rest of <br>Indonesia but from the Hinduism of India and its practice in the rest of the world. From a tourist’s <br>perspective, the Balinese openly celebrate their religious traditions in the streets and in their <br>temples. Their religion includes the people around them if they are reasonably respectful. A family <br>funeral - with its unique traditions and artistry- is open to the public. While Hinduism has deep <br>roots in serious study and practice, the Hindu-Animism of Bali feels more like a joyous <br>participation. For tourists it is accessible and inviting.</p>
     <p>&bull; Bali is a very affordable destination for tourists once they have paid their air fares. While <br>it is undeniable that it is so cheap largely due to the low salaries of the Balinese, the poverty <br>seems much less oppressive than in many parts of the third world. It seems that way because of the <br>very positive, outgoing, happy, and helpful nature of the Balinese.</p>
     <p>&bull; The artistry mentioned earlier has resulted in Balinese towns that are centered around one <br>particular craft. Some places are centers of painting, others of stone carving, yet others of silver <br>jewelry or wood carving or sarong making or custom-made clothing with unique fabrics. The Bali Aga <br>people create a unique form of weaving called Ikat and an art form that resembles scrimshaw on what <br>look like Venetian blinds of wood slats intricately carved with scenes from the Ramayana and other <br>Hindu epics. This artistry is treasured by tourists and prominently displayed in the homes of people <br>throughout the world. Frequently tourists will get a further appreciation of what they buy by seeing <br>it made in front of them or having it custom made during their stay.</p>
     <p>&bull; While there are delightful people throughout the world, the Balinese, in my opinion and that of <br>many others, are a treasure. They are good-natured, friendly, warm, playful, welcoming, inclusive, <br>generous, creative, often talented, observant, and easy-going. If you forget their name , you have <br>only to remind yourself it’s one of four names with an “e” sound before them for a woman. I have been <br>to their homes, weddings and funerals as a frequent tourist. The Balinese will always be supportive <br>of your efforts to learn Balinese and/or Indonesian. When I have encountered the Balinese on cruise <br>ships in other parts of the world, their personalities stand out there as well.</p>
     <p>&bull; I find the “liberalism” of Bali to be far more meaningful and satisfying than it's being an <br>Indonesian locale where one can drink and party. Hell, you can do that in enough locales throughout <br>the world! Until 1983, when Islamic mores forbid it, this island was “clothing optional.” Not that <br>the Balinese would have used such a term growing out of sexually uptight Western countries! They were <br>just often topless or fully naked in public swimming places, rivers, and front porches. There is much <br>that the Balinese currently hide - not just from Muslims - but from sexually immature Westerners. <br>Privately these people are very free in what they chose to do and with whom.</p>
     <p>&bull; The architecture, the art, the music, the clothing, the social mores and the Hindu-animist <br>culture are a cohesive whole. They are not separate domains. They refer to each other continually. <br>This is true of other cultures as well , but in Bali it seems all pervasive. That makes for a highly <br> interesting, beautiful, satisfying experience of another culture for tourists.</p>
